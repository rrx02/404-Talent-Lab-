# 🧠 404 Talent Lab

Welcome to my personal lab where I test, explore, and share what *actually works* in AI + Recruiting.

This repository is a mix of curiosity, experimentation, and honest insights from someone who believes AI won’t replace recruiters — but the ones who use it might. 😉

## 🧪 Why this repo exists

Because recruiters deserve better tools — and better conversations about them.  
This is my way of contributing to the future of recruiting by exploring what’s hype and what’s actually helpful.
